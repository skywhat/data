an assignment of database curriculum design.

The file data.txt includes all the datasets, not too many thanks to my teacher who sent me the file. All I have to do is pick a pattern (client/server or browser/server respectively) to realize these basic requirements such as altering, deleting, adding, searching. A report form is also needed.
I am trying to design the assignment with Django which is a prevalent Python Web framework .
